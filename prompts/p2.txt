Assume each meal takes 20 mins to finish.
When a medicine is prescribe to be taken after food then it needs to be taken immediately after the meal is finished.
If no time is mentioned then medicine has to be taken immediately after meal.
If a medicine is prescribed to be twice a day then it means morning and evening.
If a medicine is prescribed to be taken thrice a day then it means morning, afternoon and evening.
If a medicine is prescribed to be taken four times a day then it means morning, afternoon, evening and night.

I have been given a prescription as follows:
1. Tab ciplox500 - 1 tablet twice a day for 5 days after breakfast and dinner
2. Tab febrex plus or Sinarest  - 1 tablet twice a day after food after breakfast and lunch for 5 days
3. Tab montek LC one tablet once a day after dinner for 5 days
4. Syp TusQDx 7.5 ml twice a day
5. Tab disprin - one tablet to be dissolved in a glass of water and gargle it - three times a day

Based on this, and assuming that I eat my breakfast at 8:30 AM, lunch at 1:30 PM and dinner at 8:30 PM,
when should I taking the "Tab ciplox500".

Give how many times a day am I supposed to take it and then give valid timestamps for each of the time of the day
output should be in this format 
 
{
  "name": "medicine name",
  "frequency": 4,
  "timestamps": [
    "08:30:00",
    "13:30:00",
    "20:30:00",
    "22:30:00"
  ]
}
